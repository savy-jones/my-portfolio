      <h1>What is Universal Design and why is it important?</h1>
      <p>
        Universal design is an approach that aims to create environments and
        products that are usable by as many people as possible, regardless of
        their abilities or disabilities.
      </p>
      <h2>Physical Accessibility</h2>
      <p>
        Design and access should take into account the broadest range of users
        possible in order to create a world that is easier to use and more
        convenient for everyone. Having ramps and automatic doors can improve
        access for people with limited mobility, and at the same time, these
        features benefit other users like parents with strollers or delivery
        personnel carrying heavy loads.
      </p>
      <h2>Digital Accessibility</h2>
      <p>
        Similarly, universal design in the context of digital materials means
        providing user-friendly websites, applications, and other digital
        products so that they can be used by the widest range of people
        possible, including those with disabilities. Digital accessibility tools
        like captions and transcripts not only make it possible for people who
        are deaf or hard of hearing to access digital content, but also benefit
        anyone who may be watching videos in a noisy environment or trying to
        follow along in a quiet setting.
      </p>
      <h2>Inclusivity and Diversity</h2>
      <p>
        Inclusivity and diversity are key principles of universal design. This
        means designing products and environments that take into account the
        needs and preferences of a wide range of people, including people with
        disabilities, people from different cultural backgrounds, and people
        with different levels of education or literacy. By prioritizing the
        needs of diverse users, we can promote inclusive and accessible
        experiences that are more effective, efficient, and satisfying for
        everyone.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Digital Acccessibility Tools (maybe include this section? maybe move it
        up one section?)
      </h2>
      <p>
        HAVEN'T EDITED THIS PORTION. Accessibility features and design practices
        can be incorporated into websites, apps, and other digital products to
        help people with different types of disabilities use them. These tools
        are designed to create an inclusive digital environment that caters to
        everyone, regardless of physical, cognitive, or sensory abilities. For
        example, people with motor limitations may have not be able to use a
        mouse, therefore all features should be accessible using only a keyboard
        or other non-mouse input. Using high-contrast colors and simple
        typography can make it easier for people with dyslexia to read text.
        Providing alternative text for images helps people who are blind or
        low-vision understand the content of a website. Providing captions and
        transcripts for audio and video content can make it accessible to people
        who are deaf or hard of hearing. By incorporating these features and
        designing with universal principles in mind, digital products can be
        more accessible and usable by everyone, ensuring that individuals with
        disabilities can enjoy equal opportunities and access to information,
        communication, and services.
