      No. 7 -William Henry Eames William Henry Eames was born in Almo, Idaho on
      December 23, 1894 to Robert J. and Lucy Knight Eames. We lived on a farm
      in what is called the Big Cove. I was the 7th child in a family of 12. I
      was born in a log cabin that had five rooms and a back porch. It had a
      cellar where we kept our vegetables and other fresh produce, which was
      harvested, from our farm. Near the house was a large beautiful orchard
      where we raised our fruit. Close to the orchard was a shed and granary.
      The grain that was stored in the granary was used for feed and flour.
      There was a well in front of the house that my father, and brothers Lonnie
      and Robbie had dug. We used this water in our house. The woodpile by the
      well was replenished each fall. Father and the three boys would spend
      almost a whole week in the hills, which was some distance from our log
      cabin, cutting logs for the woodpile. We would cut enough to last the
      entire winter. Father went on a mission to Iowa in 1899 when I was only
      five years old; however, I had to help the older boys on the farm. I
      remember the rabbits I had under the house. I used to cut Lucerne for them
      to eat and one day, I cut my thumb so severely that I still have the scar.
      The cellar door afforded us much entertainment. My sister Ruby and I spent
      many happy hours sliding down the cellar door, which would make our dog,
      Rover, bark and play with us. One day, he became so excited that he bit
      her on the arm. I remember an old man by the name of Mr. Plumb who stayed
      with us and did odd jobs for father. He was afflicted with St. Vitas dance
      and when he drank his coffee, his hand would shake so terribly that he
      would spill it all over. One day, while we were all sitting at the dinner
      table, I laughed at him and the next think I knew, Mr. Plumb was shaking
      me good. When I was six years old, I started school. Our schoolhouse was a
      log cabin. It was about 1 1/2 -miles from our house. I walked to and from
      school each day until I was old enough to drive a team. I attended this
      school until I was about 10 and at that time father bought my Uncle Merle
      Heath's place, which was one mile west from the house we were living in.
      It was after this move that I changed schools and attended the Grape Creek
      School. I drove a team of horses hooked to a sleigh in the winter and a
      white top buggy in the spring this was much better than walking. When I
      was 10 years old, I remember that I had the job of riding the derrick
      horse and rack horse at haying time. At this time every year we would help
      our neighbors, the Durfees, who lived just over the hill from us, and they
      would help us. For recreation, my brothers, sisters and I would hunt
      rabbits, fish and ice skate. We had picnics at the City of Rocks, which
      was a nice place in the mountains (southwest of Almo) and it was in this
      area that we picked pine nuts. I remember one wintry day when it had
      turned extremely cold and I had urged the horses into a fast trot so that
      we could hurry and get to school. We came to a turn in the road and
      because we were traveling so fast, the box slid off the sleigh, which
      frightened the horses and caused them to run. I held onto the lines as
      long as I could but the horses continued to run and ran all the way to
      school. Needless to say, they got there before we did. Because father
      needed my help on the farm a great deal, I was never able to graduate from
      the 8th grade. We had good times at home, too. Mother and father bought a
      used organ, which my older sister Lizzie played when she was home. We
      would all gather around including my mother (bless her heart) and sing
      songs. Mother always taught me to pray when I was a small boy. I
      remembered these teachings throughout my life and gained much strength and
      guidance through prayer. One instance that illustrates my complete faith
      in the power of prayer happened when I was taking care of my younger
      sisters while mother and father were away. Opal was eating chicken and got
      a bone caught in her throat -it cut off her oxygen and she went black in
      the face. I told my sisters to all kneel down and pray for Opal, which
      they did and very soon she coughed up the chicken bone. Our trips to the
      mountains were not always just for picnics or pleasure. Whenever we needed
      them, my brother Robbie and I would go up after fence poles. We would go
      early in the morning and be gone all day. It would usually be dark before
      we could get loaded up. On one trip, we forgot the axe so Rob sent me down
      the canyon alone to get it. I was young and frightened half to death -in
      fact, the doctor told mother he thought that was the reason I came down
      with Typhoid Fever a short time later. It was sometime before they knew
      whether I would live or die, but finally through the fine care that mother
      gave me and through prayer, I came out of it. I had to learn to walk all
      over again. Mother and father always encouraged us to take part in church
      activities. On Saturday evenings, father would get a team of horses ready
      and would hitch them to the white top buggy on Sunday morning. Away we
      would all go to Sunday School, which as five miles away. Sometimes mother
      would prepare sandwiches and we would stay all day. We would have Sunday
      School and Sacrament Meeting soon after. One afternoon in Fast and
      Testimony Meeting, Sister Durfee, who was the President of Relief Society,
      got up to bear her testimony and started to speak in tongues. Bishop
      Durfee, her son, got up and interpreted what she said. We also attended
      Mutual. I played basketball on the Mutual team and it was while I was at
      Elba, Idaho playing basketball that I first became interested in a
      girlfriend. We enjoyed the dances sponsored by the Mutual and when a bunch
      of wild and wooly boyfriends would get together, we would really have a
      wonderful time. One night at Mutual we all got to laughing at our teacher
      who wore his glasses down on the end of his nose. Bishop Allen came in and
      took his boy out of the class; he then had the rest of us arrested by the
      constable. We all had to appear in court but were released very quickly. I
      was ordained a Deacon when I was 12 and passed the Sacrament. I fulfilled
      my requirements in the Priesthood always and was therefore, promoted, as
      should have been. With 12 children in our family, father was always very
      busy making "ends meet". Once or twice in the fall of the year, father
      would go to Montello, Nevada with a load of potatoes, apples and grain and
      had me to go with him. To get there, we traveled about 68 miles south into
      Utah and then 17 miles west into Nevada. On our way we camped out, once at
      the base of the mountain and again in Grouse Creek, Utah. We made our bed
      down by the wagons. Father drove one wagon and I drove the other. I lay
      there listening to the horses munch hay and watched the stars twinkle
      until I fell asleep. Father always took the rifle along in case we saw any
      wild animals. One morning, we started out and father saw a coyote running
      up a hill. We stopped the horses and took a couple of shots at the coyote
      -he came rolling down the hill and father sent me up to drag him down. We
      skinned him and sold the pelt when we got back home. These trips are my
      fondest memories, as a boy, of time spent with my father. John Hull bought
      a ranch in Alma when I was a young lad. He was an excellent trumpet player
      and he decided to get a group of boys and men together to form a band. My
      Uncle Harry Eames was made Assistant Bandleader and got me interested in
      playing an instrument in the band. The first instrument I had was a
      baritone, and later I changed to a solo alto. I rode a horse five miles
      once a week to practice with the band and after some time, we became a
      very fine band. We were invited to play at many celebrations and other
      gatherings. It seems that I had a nose for trouble. One afternoon I was
      riding a horse to a ballgame in Stravell, Idaho. I saw a young lady
      walking along and so I very gallantly asked her if she would care for a
      ride home. She lived down by the Raft River and when she got off the horse
      her boyfriend saw me. He took after me on his horse (he was big enough to
      eat me up). When he caught me, he dragged me off my horse and I ended up
      with a broken nose. When I was 19 (in 1913) my mother decided she wanted
      me to go to school in Oakley, Idaho to the old academy and take the
      Missionary Course. I liked the idea very much so my cousin Vern Eames and
      I went to Oakley and signed up for the course to prepare for a mission. My
      brother Rob was married but was living close enough to help father on the
      farm. However, at this time, he decided to leave so father could not spare
      me and I had to leave the school and go home. For this reason, I was never
      able to go on a mission. In 1915, father sold the ranch and came to Utah
      to care for my grandparents Alonzo and Catherine Knight who lived in Plain
      City. The Utah-Idaho Central Railroad was running a spur into the canning
      factory in Plain City and my first job was working on the tracks. About
      1917 my father bought a farm in Harrisville, Utah. My grandparents moved
      in with my family and stayed with us until their deaths. I continued to
      work for the Utah-Idaho Central Railroad on the section gang and then went
      up to work in the brickyard in Harrisville. I worked on the brick press
      and wheeled brick. It was while I was hauling that I dropped bricks on my
      left foot and smashed my big toe. I had just recently met Winnifred Lowder
      (who later became my wife) and it was her mother, Ida Lowder, who treated
      my toe every day for about two weeks. It was during this time in November
      of 1917 that I became better acquainted with Winnifred and we had an
      opportunity to teach Sunday School together. William H. Eames & Winnifred
      Lowder On August 21, 1918, Winnifred and I married. She was 19 and I was
      23. We left at 6 AM on the morning of the 21st on the Bamberger train to
      go to the Salt Lake Temple. It took us all day to go through the temple
      and return to Harrisville. World War I was raging at that time and the
      temple was filled with young service men and their brides. Because of my
      foot injury, I was not able to get into the Army. Winnifred looked
      beautiful in her white wedding dress. I gave her a plain gold wedding band
      that has since been replaced with two diamond rings set in platinum. Her
      engagement ring was a ruby set in a tiffany setting. Our daughter Betty
      Eames is still wearing the ring, which is in the original setting. After
      our wedding, Winnifred's parents, William and Ida Lowder, gave us a party.
      It was held outside on the lawn and over 250 people came. We received many
      lovely gifts. I remember driving dad's team of horses hitched to her
      folks' white top buggy to get chairs for the party and Winnifred's
      brother, Milo, going with me. I drove the team on a dead run through the
      gate onto the road. I had to make a quick turn and the buggy went on two
      wheels. Poor Milo Lowder laid flat on his stomach in the bottom of the
      buggy. He thought I was the wildest driver he had ever seen and I guess I
      frightened him nearly to death! We lived with Winnifred's folks for four
      months. They were the grandest people on earth to us. I was young and
      inexperienced so I worked at whatever job I could get. One day my
      father-in-law told me he would have to talk with Rufus Garner, Assistant
      Postmaster of the Ogden Post Office. They were good friends and after he
      talked with him, they put me to work carrying Special Deliveries. It was
      at this time that we bought a little two-room house in Harrisville. I
      borrowed Milo's bicycle and rode it back and forth from our house in
      Harrisville to the Ogden Post Office and I carried Special Deliveries on
      it all day. One Halloween night, it was late and I was in a hurry riding
      along the trail. I had to cross a ditch on a small bridge, which to my
      consternation, had previously been removed by a group of boys who were
      pulling their usual Halloween pranks. I hit that ditch and went flying
      through the air. When I picked myself up, I was surprised and very happy
      to find that neither my bicycle nor I were broken up. We lived in that
      little house in Harrisville about one year and then sold it to Hyrum
      Romrell who was our neighbor. He paid us $500, which was what we had paid
      for it originally. We bought a house at 832 26th Street in Ogden and lived
      in Ogden for the next 44 years. Our three oldest girls were born on 26th
      Street: Erma, Mildred and Betty Eames in that order. I was still working
      at the Post Office and still rode my bicycle back and forth. I worked from
      3:30 PM until midnight. After I would leave for work, Winnifred put
      Mildred and Erma in the buggy and walked up to her mother's house at 2669
      Van Buren Avenue. She stayed there until almost time for me to come home,
      and then she would wheel the girls back home. During this time, my church
      activities varied; however, I remember being Secretary of the Elders
      Quorum and a Ward Teacher. One year we borrowed Dad's car, it had hard
      rubber tires on it. We took the three girls and as we felt we had room for
      one more, we asked Winnifred's sister Dott Lowder to come with us. We
      started out at 4 AM for Almo, Idaho to see my sister Alice and her husband
      Asael Ward. On the other side of Tremonton, Utah, we had to unload and
      pack our things up the hill (this car wouldn't pull your hat off) and to
      top it all off the windshield fell out on Aunt Dott's lap. Dott was a good
      sport and held it on her lap all the way to Almo. We didn't arrive in Almo
      until 2 AM the next morning -we had a wonderful time anyway. We lived on
      26th Street for six years and then we bought a house at 1068 29th Street.
      The girls were old enough to start school and they went to Quincy School
      that was five or six blocks from our house. Our oldest daughter Erma had
      quite a time adjusting to school. Mother would take her over to school and
      she would no more than get home when Erma would arrive back home. I was in
      the presidency of the YMMIA in the 17th Ward while we lived on 29th
      Street. In fact, we helped build the 17th Ward while we lived there. Those
      were happy days. Every year we would go on a vacation and take the family
      with us. I bought an old Chevrolet and we drove to Yellowstone Park,
      Wyoming and to Canada to visit my sisters Lizzie King and Ruby McMullin
      and their families. i remember a trip to Portland, Oregon where we went to
      see my sister Lucy Stout who lived in a little town just on the edge of
      Portland. She lived in a little cabin in a beautiful grove of trees with a
      canyon close by. Near to where she lived, there was a blind man who lived
      in a little shack by the Columbia River. He earned money by setting crab
      traps in the bottom of the Columbia River to catch crabs to sell to
      restaurants. The girls had fun swinging in a big tire swing tied to the
      large trees and they also played in the canyon. This vacation trip to see
      Lucy was one of our nicest trips we ever took. We took many trips up Ogden
      Canyon for fishing and picnicking. One trip we took with Winnifred's
      brother Oscar Lowder and his family. Our car was so loaded that we had to
      drop our tent off to go up the hill and when we went back to pick it up,
      someone had taken it. We had to improvise sleeping facilities by cutting
      limbs off trees to make our bed and stretched a canvas over our heads for
      cover. We took another trip with Oscar and his family to Jackson Lake in
      Wyoming. Oscar and his family were ahead of us in their car and we were
      driving along rather cautiously on a winding road when we came to a
      hairpin turn. Because I didn't see it soon enough, instead of staying on
      the road, we took off through the brush and our oldest girl Erma landed on
      top of the 10 pounds of bananas. We all laughed despite our fright, as the
      girls were only concerned about the bananas. When we arrived at the lake,
      Oscar told us that he had almost gone off the road too. We rented a cabin
      and stayed a few days, fished and had lots of fun. It was nice to know our
      girls were having a good time along with us. Although the girls are all
      grownup now, they still reminisce about the many wonderful vacations we
      took together. Many times Winnifred and I had an extremely difficult time
      financing the trips but we loved adventure and if we camped out instead of
      renting cabins and took food along, we went very inexpensively. Much of
      the closeness, which our family maintained throughout the years, can be
      attributed to our sharing time with our girls. As our family got older, we
      had to have more room so we turned our place in on a larger house on 1022
      24th Street where our youngest daughter Carolyn Eames was born. The girls
      soon became active in the 13th Ward. Mildred and Betty studied music and
      played the piano in Primary and played duets at church gatherings.
      Winnifred became active in Relief Society and I was asked to be in the
      presidency of the YMMIA. Later, I was set apart as the Ward Clerk under
      Bishop Edward Chambers. President Samuel G. Dye ordained me a High Priest,
      which has meant a great deal to me throughout the years. My wife was good
      to help me with my church work. As Ward Clerk, I had to put in many hours
      making out reports. We made many fine and lasting friendships through our
      associations and work in the 13th Ward. Our daughters became teenagers
      when we lived on 24th Street and were always playing pranks. One time when
      my daughter Betty came in from a date, we were in bed asleep thinking that
      she was also in bed. Erma and Carolyn saw the lights go on and off in the
      living room and thought that a burglar had come in. They crept into our
      room and awakened me so suddenly that I was nearly frightened to death. As
      I grabbed the living room doorknob, poor Betty took hold of it on the
      other side. I held the door fast and shouted, "who's there?" Betty and
      laugh now because we wonder which one of us was the most frightened. While
      we were living on 24th Street, Erma met Floyd Young. They were married in
      the Salt Lake Temple. After 11 years on 24th Street, we decided to build a
      home so I bought a lot on 1100 block of Porter Avenue and built a five
      room brick house. My father passed away and mother moved to Salt Lake City
      into an apartment across the street from the Salt Lake Temple where she
      did temple work each day. For the first time in many many years, my family
      was together for father's funeral. We had our picture taken and it means a
      great deal to me now. I was the only brother alive with seven sisters. My
      sister Viola and her husband Martin Harris took over the folk's house in
      Harrisville and mother continued to live in the shadow of the temple for
      many years until she passed away. Our daughters Mildred and Betty
      graduated from Ogden High School and went to work at the Utah General
      Depot, working for the defense of our country because we were fighting
      World War II. Many people moved into the Ogden area at this time because
      many plants were built there during the war. The city government asked
      Ogden residents to build apartments in their homes to help the housing
      shortage that was created and so we finished off some rooms in our
      basement and took in some boys. This caused us nothing but headaches and
      hard work for Winnifred because the boys nearly ate her out of house and
      home. Erma and Floyd were living in an apartment in the basement of our
      home during this time. In August of 1924, I had an operation for a double
      hernia and after going to two doctors, a chiropractor, my wife's good care
      and many prayers, I finally was well enough to go back to work around the
      first of the year. When Mildred and Betty were working at the Utah General
      Depot, they both married. Mildred married Fred Wilson, Jr. who was
      employed at the Depot so they moved into an apartment in Ogden. Betty
      married Herbert Brown in the Logan Temple. He was a pilot in the Air Force
      and was stationed in Deming, New Mexico at that time so Betty moved to
      Deming, and then continued to move around with him until after the war
      ended. Erma and Floyd moved out of our basement into an apartment by
      themselves and we sold our house on Porter and moved into the Tribe
      Apartments. Our daughter Carolyn was in high school then. After we moved
      into an apartment, Winnifred was a bit freer from housework and because
      the defense plants needed help, she went to work at the Utah General
      Depot. This was the first and only time that she worked outside of our
      home. The mail load increased at the Hill Air Force Branch Post Office so
      I was asked to go work with Frank Hazen who was the Superintendent there.
      Up until this time I had worked at the Ogden Post Office since I began my
      career with the US Postal Service. I worked with Mr. Hazen until April
      1945 when I was appointed Superintendent of the Branch and he was
      appointed Superintendent of Mails. I worked there for 12 years driving 30
      miles a day. I took riders, which helped on the expense of maintaining my
      automobile. --. Winnifred & William Eames I have many pleasant memories of
      those years at Hill Field where I met many nice people. The military
      personnel invited my family to their Christmas party and would give gifts
      to the children. I bought a pair of Chinchillas for a new hobby. Since I
      had no place to keep them, I ranched them out and as time went by they
      increased in number and I enjoyed learning how to raise Chinchillas.
      Because of the sudden changes in temperature and other complications that
      arose, the Chinchillas began to die so I sold the ones that were left. In
      1951, our daughter Mildred and her husband Fred built a house on 26th
      Street. They had been living in Harris Apartments on Adams Avenue and when
      they finished their home, they moved out and we moved in their old
      apartment. I was made chairman of the High Priests group of the 6th Ward
      and held this position for two years. During this time, I was instrumental
      in helping our Quorum become the first group to put a calf on the Ogden
      Stake Welfare Farm in Huntsville. The Quorum gave donations and through
      the efforts of Brother Frank Bingham, who deals in livestock, purchased
      the calf. During the next few years, we moved several times. Carolyn quit
      high school and at the age of 17, married Marion Albiston. After they had
      three of their four children, they were sealed in the Salt Lake Temple. I
      retired on February 1, 1957 from the Post Office. Later that year, my
      daughters and their husbands took us to a lovely restaurant for dinner to
      celebrate my retirement and our 39th wedding anniversary. They gave me a
      nice book and Mildred and Fred gave me a 10-year membership in the duck
      club. This event meant a great deal to mother and I. We now live in a
      small house on #6 Custer Court where we expect to stay. We have enough
      room for our girls and grandchildren to come and visit but are not
      burdened with too much housework or yard work. Our daughters are raising
      their families now. Erma is clerking in a drug store in Ogden and her
      husband Floyd Young is a grocery Produce Manager; they have three
      children: Larry, Sharon and Ricky Young. Larry is the oldest boy and
      served six months in the Army after he graduated from high school and
      attended Weber State College and is a salesman at a men's clothing store.
      Sharon is going to Ben Loman High School and is active in her ward. Ricky
      the youngest boy is in elementary school. Erma died in 1991. Mildred was
      married 17 years before her son Randy Wilson was born and is her only
      child. She worked for First Security Bank in Ogden. She and her husband
      separated about the time that Randy was born. Betty worked for the Board
      of Education as a secretary to the Superintendent of Schools in Columbia,
      Missouri for three years. She taught junior Sunday School for 17 years and
      was in the Primary organization for 1O years. Her husband Herbert Brown
      has been active in their branch teaching and was second Counselor in the
      Superintendence of the Sunday School. He graduated from the University of
      Utah with a PhD in Anatomy and then they moved to Missouri where he taught
      and did research at the University of Missouri. He holds the rank of a
      Major in the Air Force Reserves. They have two children: James Brown is in
      high school and Kathleen Brown is in junior high. They are active in
      church and school and have both taken piano lessons. Carolyn has five
      children (four boys and one girl). Gregory Albiston is in junior high
      school; Scott, David and Deborah Albiston are in elementary school and
      Steven Albiston is the baby. They are active in their ward. Her husband
      Marion Albiston graduated from the University of Utah with a BA. He works
      for Pierce Music Company as Assistant Manager and is playing in the Utah
      Symphony as the first trombonist. Carolyn died in 1981. I am sorry I did
      not keep a diary of my life. It's difficult for me to express the fullness
      of my life and I omitted many things in order to be brief. Winnifred
      wrote: "I am thankful to Robert J. and Lucy Knight Eames for their son
      William who became my husband. We have never had worldly riches nor have
      been unkind to each other but we were blessed with four beautiful
      daughters and 11 grandchildren, which means so much to us now that we are
      older. We have always strived to live a good life and teach our family the
      same thing. The Lord blessed us in so many ways these blessings we are
      indeed grateful for. Winnifred Eames died on April 28, 1967 from heart
      failure. Three years later, William married Ethelyn Shaw. No. 8 -Marion
      Stephen Eames Marion Eames was the 8th child of Robert and Lucy Eames. He
      was named after Marion Knight, Lucy's youngest brother. He was born on May
      2, 1897 in Almo, Idaho. He was a beautiful baby and we all loved him very
      much but his stay on this earth was cut short when an epidemic of Scarlet
      Fever broke out in the community and in less than a year, he contracted
      the disease and died on March 22, 1898 at age 11 months. No. 9 -George
      Washington Eames George Washington Eames was the 9th child out of 12
      children born on February 22, 1899 in Almo to Robert and Lucy Eames. He
      had light hair and blue eyes and had a kind loving disposition. In 1917,
      he helped move his family to Plain City, Utah. In 1919 at age 20, he came
      to Canada on a visit and returned to Utah that same year in July. He went
      back with Ruby and her husband Wesley McMullin who sold their home in
      Magrath and were moving to Harrisville, Utah. George wrote the following
      letter to Lizzie after arriving home: Dear Sis: I have just been home one
      week. Got here in time to help put up the second crop of hay. We are
      having a dry spell but the crops are not bad considering. Wes got a job
      the very next day after he got here. I am glad to get back but I think
      Canada is a fine country. Ada wanted to know why you did not sell out and
      come down here to live. She thinks you are about right. I will send the
      money as soon as I can. I appreciate what you did for me. I will write
      more next time. Brother George George was engaged to be married to Ada Mae
      Taylor of Harrisville, Utah. He had planned to go on a mission when he was
      killed working for George A. Lowe in Ogden. Ada Mae was broken hearted,
      yet she was a great comfort to Lucy Eames in this greatest tragedy of her
      life. The following newspaper clipping was in the local paper of Raymond,
      Canada: "George Eames is killed in Ogden. Mr. George Eames, brother of
      Mrs. L. D. King, was accidentally killed in Ogden recently. A descending
      elevator at the Consolidated Wagon and Machine Company's warehouse struck
      him. Mr. Eames is well known here. He died December 30, 1919." 552 No. 10
      -Viola Katherine Eames "In the year of our Lord 1884, a young couple with
      two children left their home and loved ones in Utah and traveled 150 miles
      in a covered wagon to new surroundings in Idaho, to a home in the
      mountains where 10 more children were born to them. I, Viola Katherine
      Eames being the 10th child was proud of my wonderful parents. The best and
      happiest time of my life was spent with my parents, brothers and sisters
      in a four-room log cabin that had dirt for shingles. On a beautiful June
      night, my mother woke up my brother Lonnie and told him to hitch the team
      to the buggy and go after Helen Nicholas Edwards the mid-wife who lived
      about 2½ miles west of our place. There were no doctors within 25 miles of
      our town. I was born on June 28, 1901 in Almo, Idaho, while my father
      Robert Eames was filling a mission for the LDS church in Iowa. My father
      did not see me until I was 18 months old, although he wanted me named
      Viola after one of his friends in the mission field and Katherine after my
      grandmother Catherine Meguire Knight. There was an old man, a welfare
      case, who lived with us to help with the expenses by the name of Mr.
      Plumb. He, mother and the boys picked fruit and strawberries to keep the
      family and to send money to father in the mission field. In those days,
      the missionaries traveled without purse or script and depended on us to
      help them. We lived on 360 acres taking care of a large orchard that my
      Grandfather Alonzo Knight had planted. We milked cows and made butter to
      sell. Everyone worked together and had a good time doing it. When it came
      time for my father to be released, everyone was happy but me, I was
      frightened to death. I loved my older brother Lonnie and I guess I thought
      he was my father, but as time went on we got acquainted and I loved my
      father very much. A short time after my father returned, my brother Lonnie
      was called on a mission, which he never served because he came down with
      Typhoid fever. Looking back through my life, the first recollection I have
      was that of my brother Lonnie being sick and going to see him when I
      should not have gone in his room. He had Typhoid fever and soon passed
      away. I remember him being laid out in our home and how I missed him. The
      next thing I remember was sending for a baby sister out of the Sears and
      Roebuck catalog and sure enough she arrived on March 7, 1905. She was
      named Mary Eames. Annie Green was the mid-wife then and delivered her. We
      lived on a ranch about five miles from town. In Almo there was the church,
      the Eames Brothers Mercantile, a post office and a schoolhouse -that was
      town. Aunt Julia and Uncle Harry Eames had a hotel that was used by people
      who were passing through town. We didn't have close neighbors. Herman and
      Sarah Taylor were our closest neighbors who lived about 1 1/2 miles away.
      Their children Bertha and Fred Taylor were about the same age as my
      brother George Eames. Sometimes we played with them but mostly, we played
      by ourselves. George and I were real pals, and in the evenings we gathered
      around father while he sung songs and told us stories about when he was a
      little boy. I remember climbing on father's lap, combing and curling his
      hair and tying ribbons in it while he sang songs to us. I see mother
      studying her Sunday School lessons and sewing. My mother taught for 21
      years. I loved those evenings; they were very happy ones. There were six
      of us at home at this time and mother had four girls to sew and knit those
      old black long wool stockings, which I used to hate so much but it did
      keep our legs warm when we had to walk 1½ miles to school. When the snow
      got too deep, father took us to school in a sleigh. My first teacher was
      May Lowe. Our schoolhouse was up in the trees on a hill where the first
      grade through the 8th grade was all in one room. When I was a little girl,
      I remember my brother George and I catching large toads and playing like
      they were our horses. We made wagons out of matchboxes and tied the toads
      to the boxes so that they hauled grass in the boxes, playing like it was
      hay. I guess my brothers made a tomboy out of me, as I loved to go hunting
      with them. I became a very good shot, killing many sage hens and rabbits,
      which mother would cook for dinner. I loved riding horses and helping my
      brother George in breaking them. He would snub them to his horse and I
      would crawl in the saddle. I have been thrown and have had my horse rare
      over backwards with me but always came out without any broken bones. I
      helped on the ranch riding derrick horses, tramping hay, racking hay and
      milking cows. My father got mad at me one day and scolded me and I cried
      so hard that he gave me a horse of my own to shut me up. Perhaps, I had a
      method in my madness! This fancy gray mare was the fastest horse in town.
      I loved her and was very proud of her. In the fall of the year, father
      would go after wood and we all piled in the wagon taking a lunch and we
      gathered pine nuts, while the older children loaded wood onto the wagon.
      They gathered pine and mahogany; then the boys had to chop it into stove
      lengths. In the fall, the Indians would come to Alma to gather pine nuts.
      They camped outside our front gate and built a fire at night to roast the
      pine nuts. We took bread and traded it for nuts. There is nothing like
      fresh roasted pine nuts! On Sunday mornings, we all went to church in the
      white-top buggy and remained for Sacrament meeting following Sunday School
      because it was five miles to travel back and forth. We loved to go to
      church so we could visit with our friends. I remember the wonderful times
      we had on the 4th and 24th of July, running races and spending our 1O
      cents and thinking we were millionaires. Later, we traveled two miles to
      school. Sometimes when we were wet and cold, we would huddle around the
      pot bellied stove to dry out and our school teacher, Mr. Belnap would say,
      "I would like to see you when you are old, I dare say you will all have
      rheumatism." We lived at the house where I was born until my sister Mary
      Eames was born in 1905, then we moved about a half-mile to the house where
      my Uncle Merle Heath lived (he was father's half brother). Soon after
      that, my sister Opal Eames was born in 1907, which made 12 children in our
      family. We moved off the ranch for a few years when my father built a log
      house in town that had six rooms. It was real nice. Mother boarded two
      schoolteachers by the name of Miss Stapleton and Mrs. Banner. Miss
      Stapleton taught me to play the piano and I was in her room at school.
      After she left, I took piano lessons from Delpha Bronson. We did not live
      far from our beloved Uncle Harry and Aunt Julia Eames. Aunt Julia was
      mother's sister and Uncle Harry was father's brother so us kids were like
      brothers and sisters. Their children were born within six months of us so
      we each had a playmate and had lots of good times together. Ina Eames was
      my age and Louis Eames was George's age. Uncle Harry had a dance pavilion
      and we would all gather from miles around to dance. Ernie and Lena Jensen
      and their father had a dance band that would play for the dances. People
      would come far distances to see our famous City of Rocks. We used to climb
      them especially Bath Rock. If you could climb it, you were good. There
      vyas a big hole on top of the rock that was nearly always filled with
      water. Another rock that we used for shelter when a storm came up was Camp
      Rock. Our family moved back to the ranch when I was about 12. I had
      graduated from the eighth grade in the Old Cove School with Miss Johnson
      as my teacher (1913). My best friend Georgia Bruesch lived on a ranch
      about a mile and half from our place. We rode our horses all over the
      hills. One day when we were miles from home, we came to a large rock. We
      were going to get off the horses and climb it but our horses wouldn't get
      close to the rock. They would get so close and then whirl and run. As we
      looked up, there was a large Mountain Lion lying on the rock ready to
      spring on us. We took off riding like mad to the Bruesch place. Georgia's
      brother Walt brought his gun, but when we got back the mountain lion was
      gone. At nighttime, you could hear the mountain lions yelling. When I
      stayed all night at the Bruesch's place, we had to go outside to the
      outhouse. It would scare us to death when we heard those yells because
      they sounded like they were right behind us. My other friend was Maud
      Erickson and her brother Gus and all us kids in the cove would gang up in
      the evenings riding into town for the mail. We had races and did trick
      riding all the way to town and back. In those days, Gus Erickson was my
      boy friend and in the wintertime, we went to bobsledding parties.
      Sometimes, we tied a small sleigh on the back of the bob sleigh and took
      turns riding and taking spills in the snow. One day Ernie Jensen came up,
      gathered a load of us kids to take to his house for a birthday party. He
      was running the horses and turned a curve fast and tipped the sleigh over
      on top of us. Luckily, no one was hurt; we just picked ourselves up and
      went on to the party. Ernie was also one of my boy friends when I was a
      kid. We sure had lots of fun and someone was always thinking up something
      to do. Mr. Jensen was sure a lot of help to the young people of Almo; all
      the young people liked him. My brother-in-law Al Stout played the violin
      and we had dances up to big Jim Durfees -he had a large room and played a
      large violin. My parents were very hard working people and very unselfish.
      When their aged parents asked them to move back to Utah to take care of
      them, they sold everything they possessed and moved, settling in
      Harrisville where they cared for my grandparents Alonzo and Catherine
      Knight until their deaths. So my parents with five children (William,
      George, myself -Viola, Mary & Opal) moved. I was 16 (in 1917) when we
      moved and stayed with the family from July to September, at which time I
      was sent to Salt Lake City to study to become a nurse. I lived with the
      Morris family and worked for my board and room before and after school. I
      went to school for 1 ½-years. While I was in SLC, my folks bought a farm
      in Harrisville. They moved Grandpa and Grandma Knight in with them. My
      grandparents had their own two rooms in the back of the house. When I came
      home for Christmas vacation, my brother George was working at the
      brickyard at nights. I wanted to see him so my sister Mary and I walked up
      the road to the brickyard. A young by the name of Martin Harris came by in
      a beautiful new black buggy pulled by a beautiful black horse and stopped
      to ask us where we were going. We told him and he said, "jump in and I'll
      take you there" so we did and that is how I met my husband. I did not go
      back to school. When my father died, mother moved to Salt Lake City and
      did temple work until her death in 1948, enjoying every minute of it.
      Martin Harris I was born March 8, 1898, a son of Martin Dennis Harris and
      Lillie Rosetta Hayes in a brick house just west of the railroad tracks in
      Harrisville, Utah. My great Uncle was Martin Harris who was the witness of
      the Book of Mormon. On March 8, 1906, I was baptized into the LOS church
      on my birthday. I had a great boyhood with days of hunting, fishing and
      swimming in the canal. My friend and myself liked to ride horses thinking
      we were cowboys. We used to ride along side of freight trains and catch on
      the handles and ride the train to the Hot Springs and walk back. I had to
      drive four head of horses to the Sugar Factory for a load of beet pulp in
      the wintertime so that my father could feed his cows. One winter I made
      over $600 trapping muskrats. I trapped them as far north as the Utah Hot
      Springs. I worked on the thrashing machine and thinned sugar beets. We
      packed grain for the thrasher all day for 50 cents an hour. One evening, a
      friend and myself were riding our horses along the road. There were some
      older boys who were pushing a railroad handcar. They asked us to put a
      rope on each side of the track and pull them. We pulled them until they
      were going fast and just as we rounded a curve, there was the dummy engine
      coming. We had no way of stopping the hand car so it ran into the engine
      and the kids went flying in every direction but no one was hurt. My friend
      and I were always riding our horses and one evening, we decided to get up
      in the teacher's office where they had hot chocolate and donuts for lunch.
      We threw our ropes up onto the ledge and climbed up the rope. The teachers
      could not find out how we had got up there and offered a $5 reward to
      anyone that would give them information. I used my dad's team to sprinkle
      the roads to keep the dust down. One day, dad sent me up to Fielding, Utah
      to help my Uncle Emer clean the canal, as I was old enough to drive the
      team. When I left, there wasn't any electricity west of the railroad
      tracks and when I came home and got off the streetcar at Harrisville,
      every house was lit up with electricity. It seemed so funny! I had a good
      team of horses and when people would slide off the road, they came to me
      to pull them back on the road. My team saved my life one time by pulling a
      load of hay off the tracks when a train was coming. In September of 1916,
      my dad, Levi J. Taylor, Leander S. Harris, Lewis Shurtleff and myself used
      father's horse to haul three sections of pipe and cement and tools to the
      top of Lewis Peak. We had to drill a hole in the rock, to put the pole in,
      put a brass plate on the pole and cemented our names in the bottom of the
      pole. While climbing to the top, one man got behind and I went back down
      with water and food to help him back up to the top. The peak was named
      Shurtleff of Harrisville. Viola Eames & Martin Harris Martin and I went
      together until September 13, 1918, when we were married in the Salt Lake
      Temple. On October 12, 1919, "Douglas" Martin Harris was born. Martin
      worked at the brickyard for $3 a day. On July 2, 1921, Marion "Robert"
      Harris was born. On March 16, 1924, a very black-headed baby girl was born
      whom they named Shirley Harris. Sometimes, they made fried chicken and
      picked up a gallon of root beer to go to the canyon for a picnic, let the
      children play and watch squirrels run down their holes. The war came along
      and Martin was classified 1 A and was all ready to go when the Armistice
      was signed on November 11, 1918. The whistle blew for 30 minutes and
      everyone was making all the noise they could. George Eames and Martin were
      topping sugar beets for Mrs. Connely at the time. For a long time, there
      were only three automobiles in Harrisville. It was horse and buggy days
      and that was their only transportation. They walked to church. They always
      had a good celebration on the 4th of July. There were three-legged sack
      races, wheel barrel races and all kinds of foot races. There was always a
      big horse race. Once there were two thoroughbred racehorses in the race
      and Martin had a saddle horse that was a fast runner and he won the race.
      Martin used to train his horse to run down his father's lane by the field
      when he went after cows. Bishop Brown and several other men bet on his
      horse and won some money. His horse died in 1925 of brain fever; a lot of
      good horses died that year of the disease. Martin liked to hunt ducks and
      would get 25 ducks a day, selling them to people in town for extra
      spending money. His brother Alma Harris and he went goose hunting west of
      Corinne and brought home 26 big geese. They had to make two trips to carry
      them. He liked deer hunting and in 1936, he killed a deer at Lost Creek
      and it weighed in at 278 pounds at the Kemmerer, Wyoming sports store.
      Martin wrote: "I had lots of jobs but didn't like any of them!" I was a
      brakeman on the Southern Pacific railroad, a streetcar motorman, a boiler
      maker's helper at Ogden Iron works, a salesman for Utah Bottling works and
      I was also a director for the Western Irrigation Company for 20 years. In
      1932, we bought the Robert Eames farm so that Martin could work at the
      things he loved, farming. Grandpa and Grandma Knight had passed away so
      they moved in with Robert and Lucy Eames. Robert passed away and Lucy
      moved into a small apartment across from the temple devoting her life to
      doing temple work. After Lucy died, the war broke out and the government
      wanted land to build a supply depot so they took the farm along with other
      farms to build this depot in 1941. Martin and Viola moved and Martin got a
      job as a fireman at the Navy Supply Depot holding this job for 18 years
      until they closed the Ogden Depot after World War II. Martin rode with the
      Weber County Sheriff Posse for 10 years. He went as far north as
      Blackfoot, Pocatello, Burley, and Rupert, Idaho, and also Elko, Nevada to
      perform. Viola and Martin both belonged to the Wasatch Riding Club and won
      several trophies and ribbons. Riding in pairs, a square dance was
      performed in the Ogden stadium during the 24th of July celebration and in
      several other places in Idaho and Wyoming. In 1944, they bought another
      farm in Harrisville. He worked two jobs until the Depot closed, farming
      being the second job. After the Navy Depot closed, he drove a school bus
      for four years, retiring at age 65. We celebrated our 50th and 60th
      wedding anniversaries. Douglas Harris was in the Army when the war broke
      out and Robert went into the Navy. Douglas Harris married Maxine Carssey
      and they had one son and a daughter. Robert Harris married Fay Williams
      and they had three girls and a boy. Shirley Harris married Jesse Layton
      after he came back from the war and they had four boys and one girl. They
      live in Eden, Utah. Viola worked as a counselor in the MIA, 1st counselor
      in the Relief Society and taught primary for 22 years. She was a hard
      worker and helped harvest crops as well as keep house while raising her
      children. She worked at the reform school and at the detention home, she
      tried to help troubled youngsters. She loved children and worked for many
      years at a daycare center. She was a member of the DUP Sarah Jane Taylor
      Camp. She served as Election Judge with Ada Taylor for 25 years. While
      standing next to the road in front of her home on a Sunday, Viola was
      killed when a car hit her on April 5, 1981. Martin died on April 19, 1985.
      No. 11-Mary Larenna Eames I was born on March 7, 1905 at Almo, Idaho -the
      11th child in a family of 12 to Robert and Lucy Eames. Because I was the
      first child born after my father returned from a mission in Iowa, I was
      named Mary Larenna Eames after a very dear friend that father had in the
      mission field. We lived so far from a store that most of our clothing and
      household articles were purchased from a mail order house. Happy was the
      day when the mail brought a large package with new shoes, coats, underwear
      and perhaps material for a new dress. My sister Viola, who was nearly four
      years old than I, sent for me from the Sears and Roebuck catalog. The
      following is a poem that my dear sister Viola wrote for me on my 58th
      birthday: I have a catalog sister, I sent for her sometime ago. There were
      times I was lonely & missed her, Until an angel brought her to our door.
      She was a spirit from heaven, And was waiting to come, I'm sure. But to me
      she as something special, I had picked from a dozen or more. Time has a
      way of passing, And gone are our childhood days. She became a beautiful
      lady, So kind and thoughtful and gay. I had a very happy childhood in a
      very happy home, with love of my dear father and mother, and brothers and
      sisters. I remember kneeling in prayer each morning around the breakfast
      table; it was one of my chores to put the chairs, with the backs against
      the table. We all took our turn at prayer; at night before going to bed,
      we would say our individual prayers taught to us by a dear wonderful
      little mother. She taught us the importance of faith, truth, and virtue
      and how important it was to keep all the commandments of our Heavenly
      Father. It was my mother who helped me gain a testimony of the Gospel,
      which I hold most dear. I learned from my dear parents how important it
      was to keep the Sabbath Day Holy. I believe Saturday was the busiest day
      in the week, getting ready for the Sabbath, our Sunday meals were
      prepared, and the old wash boiler was filled with water and heated on the
      old back wood-burning stove. Each one of us took our turn bathing in the
      kitchen behind the blankets strung up on chairs around the big round wash
      tub. Sunday morning, all clean and dressed in our best, we piled into the
      big white-top buggy pulled by two faithful horses, which father drove
      about five miles to Sunday School. We stayed on to Sacrament Meeting. I
      remember my dear mother was my Sunday School Teacher for many years and
      the beautiful stories she taught from the Bible still remain in my memory.
      I remember the happy times playing with my younger sister, Opal, building
      playhouses with rocks, there were plenty to be found in the sagebrush. We
      would outline each room leaving openings for doors. The chairs, tables and
      stoves were made of rock. I used to love to make mud pies in a tin can,
      stirring them with a stick and baking them in old fruit jar lids. The big
      swing hung from one of the trees in front of the house. We roasted pine
      nuts that we had gathered a mile or two from our home. It was not always
      play for there was always work to be done. I rode the derrick horse that
      pulled the hayfork full of hay to the top of the stack. There were no
      barns to keep the hay; just big stacks scattered about the fields with a
      fence around each group of stack to keep the livestock out. I remember
      mother cooking for days to prepare for the threshers, who would come with
      the big threshing machine, which was operated by horses. The threshers
      would come with their bedding rolls to sleep in the clean straw and it
      would take them several days to thresh all the wheat my father and
      brothers hauled from the fields. Of course, mother and my sisters had to
      feed the hungry men. After the threshers left, we would all get busy and
      help empty the old straw ticks, which were our mattresses, wash the ticks
      and refill them with the nice clean straw. The hand loomed carpet was
      taken up, hung on the clothes line and we took turns beating it with a
      broom; the old straw was swept from the floor and the floor scrubbed
      clean, fresh straw put down and the carpet stretched over and tacked down
      all around the room. Each week we would take turns turning the old wooden
      washing machine. It had a big wheel with a handle, which when turned would
      make the dolly turn inside and swish the clothes around in the water and
      suds, made from homemade soap. Mother made the soap from the fat cut from
      the animals that father killed for our meat supply for the winter. The old
      orchard gave us plums, winter pears and several kinds of apples. It was
      fun to turn the cider press when the apples were harvested. How we loved
      that home made cider! I remember when the ground squirrels were so thick
      that father paid Opal and I one cent for every tail we would bring home.
      Every morning we would go out in the field and set our traps by their
      holes. We had about 20 traps and it was difficult to remember where we had
      set them. We each had a pocket knife and a club and if they weren't dead,
      we had to hit them over the head, then cut off their tails and put them in
      a little box. It makes me shudder to think of it now, but we would each
      earn about 1O cents a day, thinking we were rich. In the evenings, father
      sat by the kerosene lamp reading while mother mixed bread, darned or
      knitted socks, sewed or was busy preparing for the next day. There was
      such a pleasant happy feeling of contentment and closeness in our family.
      I would sometimes stand behind father's chair, combing and curling his
      beautiful white hair. He always left a piece of longhair right in front
      and when I would wet it, I could wave it or make a curl on top of his
      head. Several yards from the house was a granary where we kept grain and
      attached to it was the buggy shed where big hooks on ropes hung from the
      roof to hold the tongues of the buggies. One day when I was eight or nine,
      my sister Opal and I were swinging on these ropes. We stood on a box to
      reach the ropes and then kicked the box away to swing until we were tired
      of holding on; then we would see how far away we could land. On one of my
      big swings, I let go and the hook caught in my nostril and ripped it open
      about ½ inch. Mother worked to stop the bleeding. She glued it together
      with a piece of sticking plaster. She did a good job because I have just a
      small scar. In the summer of 1917, when I was 12, my parents moved to
      Plain City, Utah to care for my grandparents Alonzo and Catherine Knight.
      My grandmother because of a serious accident had become deaf in her 20's
      and eventually blind in her 50's. Grandfather Alonzo was losing his sight
      and they needed help. Later, that same year, my father purchased a farm in
      Harrisville, Utah and we moved my grandparents with us to Harrisville. It
      was a wonderful experience to have our dear grandparents live with us for
      I loved them dearly. We talked to grandmother by forming letters on her
      hand, which spelled what we wanted to say to her. She would repeat the
      letters and words back to us so we knew she understood what we were
      saying. She was exceptionally quick and we used to read books to her,
      which she loved very much. I attended high school and one year of college
      at Weber Normal College at Ogden. The summer of 1923 I attended summer
      school at the University of Utah and that fall through a teacher's
      placement service, I went to Etna, Wyoming where I taught 3rd & 4th and
      5th grades. The next summer I attended the first National Summer School
      ever to be held in Utah at the Agricultural College in Logan. I taught
      1si, 2nd & 3rd grades from 1924 through 1926 at Milton, Morgan County,
      Utah. Mary Eames & Milton Shurtleff I married Milton Shurtleff in the Salt
      Lake Temple on September 15, 1926 and we have had a very happy life
      together and have four beautiful daughters. Elaine Shurtleff was born
      March 19, 1928 and married Arthur Naisbitt Webb on August 12, 1947. They
      have two daughters: Christine Webb and Kathy Ann Webb. Joye Ann Shurtleff
      was born November 5, 1932 and married Howard Eugene Dransfield on June 8,
      1953. They had two boys and two girls: Mark Howard Dransfield Holly
      Dransfield David Shurtleff Dransfield Nancy Dransfield Kathleen Shurtleff
      was born on March 23, 1939 and married Lowell Skeen Peterson on September
      9, 1958. They have a boy and a girl -Dale Lowell Peterson and Laurie
      Peterson. At this writing, they live in an extraordinary new home in Eden,
      Utah with an unparalleled view of the valley. Susan Shurtleff was born
      October 11 1944. She attended Weber College. Sh~ married David Vandehei.
      We have much to be thankful for; our children have been married in the
      temple and are active in the church. My dear husband was release from
      being a bishop of the 43rd Ward in Ogden. At this writing, they live in
      Alpine, Utah in a beautiful new home. No. 12 -Opal Irene Eames Opal Eames
      was the 12th child of Robert and Lucy Eames, born on January 21, 1907 in a
      log cabin in the cove at Almo, Idaho. It was very cold and windy and my
      mother was very sick and in the anxiety for her life, I was wrapped and
      laid back until they were sure my mother's life would be spared. When
      their attention turned to me, I had taken cold so I could not cry aloud.
      Father caught a weasel and skinned it so I wore a weasel skin on my chest
      until I was six months old. My mother's health was poorly all winter. She
      hemorrhaged so severely that she was very weak. I was raised on goat milk
      and honey. My father fixed a large swing in the tall poplar tree where
      mother could swing and get plenty of fresh air to help her gain her
      strength back. The memories I have of the old log home are the happiest
      memories of my childhood. The house as I remember it had three rooms: my
      parent's room, the kitchen in between and a large room with an organ and
      two large beds. The boys, William and George slept in one bed at one end
      of the room and Viola, Mary and I slept in the other bed at the other end
      of the room. We all shared our big clothes closet. There was a large porch
      where we had a washer that worked using a handle back and forth. We had a
      hand pump on the porch and a cooler made with a frame and burlap sack
      tacked around it with a large pan of water on top and streamers hanging
      over it to keep the burlap wet so as to keep things cool inside. The privy
      was some distance from the house where we kept last year's catalog. Our
      house was always clean and comfortable. We used a wood cook stove and
      kerosene lamps. On winter evenings, we would roast pine nuts in the big
      pan in the oven for a treat. In the mornings, we would always start our
      day off kneeling around the table in family prayer. My place at the table
      was standing up at the corner between mother and father. I must have been
      10 years old before I rated a chair. I remember once when I was four or
      five, I was very sick and couldn't keep anything in my stomach. Mother
      tried _to get me to drink some tea and I said, "No I'm no man." I didn't
      start school until I was eight years old, mainly because there was no
      children my age to start school. We walked 1 ½ miles over huge snow banks
      and over fences to school. This was a short cut, by the road it was two
      miles. The first year at school, I was put in the 3rd grade at Almo
      School. We rode in a sleigh during the snowy times or on horseback. In the
      summer, my sister Mary and I would pull wool off fences for a few cents
      each or trap squirrels for a penny a tail. Father had many sheep, cows,
      hogs, chickens and raised wheat and hay. We owned two buggies -a large
      white top or surrey for the family to go to church in and a black top
      one-horse buggy. Mother drove the black top one to Relief Society or to
      town mostly. When I was eight, my father baptized me in the Almo Hot
      Springs. Bishop Lorenzo Durfee confirmed me the following day on Sunday.
      On July 24, Almo used to have a big celebration with covered wagons, and
      Indians all painted riding horseback, etc. Mother made me a bonnet like
      hers and I was riding in the wagon with my parents and an Indian rode up
      and asked Father if I could go with him to cause a little excitement.
      Father wanted me to go and I started to cry because I was afraid. Father
      told me who it was and that he was only playing an Indian but I still
      wouldn't go with him. We made camp down by the creek in the churchyard.
      Campfires were built; women washed clothes and cooked meals. Mother and I
      walked up the creek and found some watercress. I've always liked
      watercress since that time. My mother's parents in Plain City were getting
      old and feeble. Grandpa Knight was 86 and grandma was 83. We sold our
      place in Almo and moved to Plain City, Utah in two covered wagons in July
      of 1917, bringing the household belongings in one wagon and the family in
      the other. My two brothers, William and George, drove one wagon and my
      parents, Mary and I were in the other one. It took four days to make the
      trip, which is about 140 miles. The wagons were heavily loaded. The
      chuckholes were bad in places, which made the wagons tip from side to
      side. We camped at nights, made a fire and cooked our supper, fed and
      watered horses, then made our bed down along side the road in back of the
      wagons. One night, I remember, we made our beds near an alfalfa field and
      the mosquitoes were so bad -that was my first experience with them. In the
      mornings, mother prepared breakfast while father and the boys took care of
      the horses and made ready to travel again. For our noonday meal, we ate
      from the grub box in the wagon. To make time pass more quickly for us,
      Mary and I would count the white horses we saw. As we neared Brigham City,
      we started to count the automobiles. After we had counted up to 50, it
      wasn't fun anymore. Grandfather and Grandmother Knight were very happy to
      have us with them. They lived in a four room adobe house, two rooms
      downstairs and two rooms upstairs. We had to talk to Grandmother Catherine
      on her hands. I learned to spell my name on her hands and she was very
      pleased. I couldn't talk to her so I'd want her to talk to me, so I'd take
      her hand and lay it across her breast and that would mean I wanted her to
      tell me a story. For a treat, she would dip a piece of bread in the cream
      on the top of a pan of milk, then sprinkle it with sugar. Our stay in
      Plain City was less than two months. Father invested in a 10-acre place in
      Harrisville, Utah, about 10 miles east of Plain City. We moved our
      grandparents with us. They had two rooms to themselves and we shared the
      same bathroom. This was a very modern, red brick house. It had a full
      basement with electric lights and hot and cold running water. To make his
      living, Father had several milk cows, raised alfalfa and had 500 layer
      hens. The following summer after we moved to Harrisville, father had to
      return to Almo on business. I went with him in a wagon drawn by horses. On
      seeing our old home, I was heartsick because it looked so rundown. While
      in Almo, we stayed at Uncle Harry Eames' place. On our return home at Bear
      River, the wagon broke so we had to make camp a mile or so out of town.
      Father walked back to town to get some welding done and left me at the
      camp with the wagon. I waited for hours and I cried and tried to sleep. I
      walked around until I felt I had to go find my papa so I took off for
      town. After I got there, I didn't know how to find him and started
      knocking on doors asking if they had seen my papa and that he had white
      hair. After several negative answers, I walked back to the wagon. Things
      were the same; I got scared and knelt down to pray, then fell asleep. I
      awoke with the sound of father's footsteps. I was so happy to see him and
      I felt my prayers were answered. He got the wagon fixed and we returned
      home safely. I loved being with my papa. I always felt that he was wise
      and whatever he said was right. I loved to hear him sing his funny little
      songs. My mother had a deep devotion to her parents. While they lived with
      us, she scarcely went any place and never left them alone. She always made
      sure that someone was there to stay with them. I read several books and
      many stories to Grandmother Catherine on her hands. After I came home from
      school, my first duty was to read for an hour or so to my grandparents who
      would listen. In the evenings in the summer time, Grandpa Knight would ask
      me to go to the Artesian well and get a cup of cold water for them. I
      didn't like going out at night to get the water but I always did. One
      night I thought I'd get it from the faucet in the sink. Then I heard
      grandfather spell on grandmother's hand "Opal is a good girl to always go
      out to the well to get us water. I am going to give her 50 cents". I
      quickly poured the water in the sink and ran to the well for the water. I
      finished elementary school in Harrisville; the 9th grade I finished at
      Milan Fort School. During my sophomore year at Ogden High School, I took
      sick with rheumatic fever. I had such pains in my wrists and the best
      medicine that they could give me was to have mother sit and rub my hands
      and wrists. Since that time, I have thought so much of the love and care
      she gave me. My grandparents always set the table in their kitchen, then
      came to our kitchen to get their meals. One morning mother told me to go
      see why Grandpa Knight was so late in coming after their breakfast. When I
      went into their room, I found him lying across the floor. He and grandma
      had had prayers and when he went to get up to come after their breakfast,
      he had a stroke. He had not completely recovered from this stroke when he
      had another one. This last stroke claimed his life at the age of 93.
      Mother's time was all the more taken up with Grandmother Knight, sometimes
      to my father's resentment. Opal Eames' Nursing Career During my sophomore
      year at school, made up my mind that I wanted to become a nurse so mother
      made my blue and white striped uniforms, which was the regulation of the
      hospital. I entered the Dee Hospital on April 2, 1924 at the age of 17. I
      loved being a nurse and helping the sick. After three months, I was proud
      to wear a white cap and bib with my uniform and apron. After I had been at
      the hospital as a nurse for a year, a young man was brought in for an
      appendix operation. He was in the men's ward with six or eight others and
      of course, just another patient. I carried bedpans or took their
      temperatures. On the second or third day, he called me Opal. I was very
      indignant with him and said, "My name is Miss Eames, if you please, Mr.
      Blackburn." Then of course, he had me flustered. He was very good looking
      and I noticed on his chart that he was LOS. After that when I took his
      temperature, I think my pulse raced harder than his pulse -so this is how
      we met. After Alva had been at the hospital a week, he got his clothes and
      walked home, which was about a mile. After he left, I missed him and was
      disappointed for I didn't know if I'd ever see him again. A couple of days
      passed and he came back to the hospital, which made me very happy. After
      going together for four months, he gave me a ring. Now it was the policy
      of the hospital that nurses were not allowed to date ex-patients. When the
      main supervisor found out that I had a ring, which I pinned under my apron
      while I was on duty, she was furious and gave me such a talking to that I
      cried until it made me sick. I went home for a couple of weeks and planned
      to go back but as the time neared, I decided I'd rather prepare for
      marriage. In September of 1925, I helped mother make me a quilt and I
      spent a lot of time with Grandma Knight. She gave me a stronger testimony
      of the gospel because she had met the Prophet Joseph Smith. Opal Eames &
      Alva Blackburn On June 2, 1926 in the Salt Lake Temple, "Al" and I were
      sealed for time and all eternity. We were very much In love and still are.
      Our first home was in Ogden, Utah. On March 15, 1927, our first child,
      Elva Jean Blackburn was born. We named her after Al’s Aunt Elva. Al was
      working at the Security Bank in Ogden as a bookkeeper. His health became
      poor and he felt he needed a change. His brother Elvin Blackburn had a job
      in Klickitat, Washington in a lumber camp and wrote saying there was work
      there. He asked Al to come work there and bring Elvin's wife Pearl with
      him. We went to Washington and when we arrived, there was no housing so we
      rented a house tent. It had a board floor and was built up on the sides
      with 1x12s and had a tent top. It was nice enough for the summer. Elvin,
      Pearl, Al, Jean and I lived there for a couple of months until houses were
      available. We lived in Klickitat three years and during those years three
      more children were born to us: Alva Dee Blackburn, called Alva after his
      father and Dee because of Dee Memorial Hospital. Al's mother was with us
      at the time and "Bud", as he was called, was born on October 9, 1928 on
      his grandmother's birthday. A year later, Grandmother Blackburn made
      another visit for a baby girl who arrived on December 8, 1929. When Veva
      Mae Blackburn was just a day old, her father was hurt and was taken to The
      Dalles, Oregon for a hernia operation. He was there a month while Grandma
      Blackburn stayed with me, which I really appreciated. It was the dead of
      winter and we had no car but had plenty of wood to burn for warmth and she
      was a lot of company and comfort to me. On October 18, 1930 our 4th child
      was born whom we named Betty Lucille Blackburn (named after a neighbor
      girl who came over to play with Jean). My sister Lucy Stout came to stay
      with me; her home was in Vancouver, Washington at the time. When Betty was
      a few weeks old, Fred and Ann Brown came to see us. They were old friends
      and lived in Willows, California. He offered Al a job at the Lucerene
      Creamery if we could get to California. Al liked Klickitat because the
      fishing was good and he had been promoted at the lumber mill but I thought
      this was a good chance to get away and do something else. We had only been
      to church six times in three years because we had to borrow a car to go to
      The Dalles, Oregon across the Columbia River. We sold our belongings, took
      nothing except our clothing and one trunk, and took a train to Willows,
      California. We arrived at night with no place to stay and very little
      money with four small children. Veva Mae couldn't walk, not being a year
      old and we also had our tiny baby Betty. We found the Brown's and stayed
      with them a few days until we had a payday and found a house. We only
      lived in Willows a year. Al's sister Elda Blackburn stayed with us that
      summer in Willows and in October, Al made arrangements for us to go to
      Ogden on the train. Our 5th child, Anita Gay Blackburn was born in Ogden
      at Grandmother Blackburn's on November 1, 1931. My father Robert Eames
      blessed her and gave her a name. At this time, he was just recovering from
      a bad fall he had taken through the hayloft onto the barn floor breaking
      both of his feet. He had to walk with a cane and it hurt me to see my
      father crippled. We were in Ogden two months before we returned to
      California. I stayed at Grandmother Blackburn's most of the time because
      she had more room for all the children. Sometimes we stayed at mother's in
      Harrisville but it was right after my brother Robert Eames had died with a
      tumor on the back of his brain and his wife Bessey Eames and family lived
      in part of the house. While we were in Ogden, Al transferred to Hanford,
      California to Swifts & Company Creamery so he packed our belongings and
      moved us into a comfortable house just a few blocks away from his work on
      Park Avenue. When we returned to California, we were in a new home and
      town. Bertha Blackburn and her oldest son, Fife Blackburn helped me home
      on the train with all the children, which I felt I couldn't have managed
      alone. We were happy to be home. There was a wonderful surprise waiting
      for me -our first washing machine. That summer Anita Gay got pneumonia.
      The doctor wanted to hospitalize her but we wouldn't consent so we had the
      Elders administer to her and she became well again. This gave us the
      opportunity to get acquainted with a few members of the church and become
      active again. There were only four or five families that belonged to the
      church in Hanford and we held Sunday School in an upstairs lodge building.
      In September 1932, Jean started Kindergarten. The next fall, Bud started
      Kindergarten and our family was growing up. He was a good marble player
      and always came home with his pockets bulging with marbles and the knees
      of the pants worn out. We moved to a cement house ori Ivy Street in
      Hanford, across the street from the school and became active in the church
      but we had to depend on someone to take us because we did not have a car.
      Primary was held at Martha Campbell's home and some times we had 12
      children there. In April of 1934, Grandmother Blackburn came to see us.
      This time we had a baby boy who was born on April 30, 1934. We named him
      Edward Carl Blackburn after an Elder that we had thought so much of. The
      missionaries came to live with us. We let them have our front bedroom and
      they ate their meals with us. At this time, AL as making $19 a week at
      Swift and Company but we can say that we never wanted while the
      missionaries lived in our home. When Eddie was 10 months old, he walked
      and could handle himself well at a year. We had a large lawn in front of
      our home and a gold fishpond lay in the middle of the lawn. The children
      would come home for lunch and stay until the bell rang and run across the
      street to school. On May 15, 1935 after I heard the school bell ring, I
      went out to look for the baby because he was out with the children. I
      looked quickly around the house calling him, then ran to the front and I
      screamed for I saw him face down in the fishpond. I pulled him out (this
      was the hardest thing I have ever done and to this day, have never gotten
      over it). A neighbor took us to the hospital; they did all they could. Al
      was at work and came to the hospital. Nothing more could be done. This
      horrible nightmare -can't we shake it? Won't we wake up and find out lives
      happy again? Somehow the neighbors took over. My dear husband helped
      comfort me even though he was in shock too. Plans and permissions were
      made to take our baby to Ogden for burial after a funeral in Hanford. We
      took his little casket in the back of a friend's car, one seat coupe and
      the four of us rode to Ogden. Another funeral was held and we buried Eddie
      in Ogden Cemetery. Our friends in Hanford watched our children while we
      were in Ogden. Soon after we returned, we moved because of the memories of
      that place, although we did fill in the fishpond with dirt. We rented a
      house on Ivy Street and a year later, Grandma Blackburn came to our house
      to welcome Marilyn Joyce Blackburn on June 13, 1936. We were happy again
      to have a baby in our house. During this year, Al was set apart as Branch
      President over Hanford and Visalia and every Sunday, we traveled to
      Visalia so we got our first car. When Marilyn was a year old, we traveled
      to Harrisville, Utah. Father was very sick and when we arrived, he had
      passed away. All the family was home for the funeral. It was hard to leave
      mother to return to Hanford but arrangements were made that Aunt Julia
      Eames would stay with mother so she wouldn't be alone. To me my mother was
      always the most lovable, perfect person who had ever lived. I have always
      wanted to pattern my life after her but my faults are numerous and I can't
      think of one she had. I felt envious of some of my sisters that had her
      near them during their married lives, as I never did. After returning to
      Hanford, we moved to Dorsett's. They lived in a large house on a farm,
      which was plenty big to accommodate two families where we shared expenses.
      We lived there one year and Robert Eames Blackburn was born on January 30,
      1938; he was named after my father. He was a lovable baby. The next summer
      we moved back into town, lived there a year and then moved to the ranch.
      We had five cows and two horses, and a few pigs and chickens. This was a
      new experience for us but something we wanted to do. Al worked at Safeway,
      a grocery store and milked cows early and late. We all worked. We went on
      one trip a year to the St. George Temple with several couples. When it
      came time to go, we'd sell a calf so we'd have money for the trip. We
      lived on the ranch for three years and Thomas Henry Blackburn was born on
      April 19, 1940, being named after Al's father. When Thomas was a year old,
      we moved to Porterville and bought a 40-acre ranch on December 1, 1941.
      This ranch only had a well on it so we lived in town while a home was
      built. The children attended Belleview School. On December 15, 1941, we
      had another boy at the Porterville Hospital whom we named Douglas James
      Blackburn. I was very sick and hemorrhaged and it took a long time to get
      my strength back. Golda Wrey a friend from Hanford stayed with me after I
      got home until I was strong enough to take over my responsibilities. In
      January of 1942, Grandmother Blackburn died and Al went to Ogden for a
      week. A milk barn was erected and we moved into the barn. We had upper and
      lower bunks for beds and it worked out nicely. We had a tent for our
      kitchen. Jean caught a bus into town to attend high school. My other
      children walked to school. We planted cotton and all the family was
      required to chop cotton. The baby took sick. Al made arrangements to rent
      a cabin in Woodville so I could have clinic privileges. Al and the other
      children got sick, all had diarrhea. We were in the camp for three weeks.
      The children would get better and then sick again. We were having a bad
      time and I was about worn out. Sister Viola Frazier asked us to live with
      her in her home and the children soon recovered except the baby got worse.
      Douglas was six months old when he went into convulsions. He died at the
      hospital right after we arrived and he was buried in Porterville. Our life
      on the farm was very rugged for the next few years. We finally got a
      three-room house with a bath. Bud slept in the barn. We added three more
      rooms and a porch. While this part of the house was being built, the river
      flooded over our property and washed away our building materials and
      chickens. Al got the family out of the house first and into the car so we
      could go to the Fraziers. When we left, the water was filling up our
      house. It was hard to leave my husband and two older children. While we
      were at the Frazier's, the children took diarrhea again. There was no way
      to get in touch with Al. After four days, Bud walked eight miles to see
      us. The next day we went home and the water was out of the house, Al had
      cleaned it for us but the second flood came a week later and in the middle
      of the night, we had to leave again. Our loss was tremendous, all the
      topsoil was gone and our next year's cotton crop failed. Our 11th child
      William Keith Blackburn was born on May 26, 1943; we named him after
      William Wells Meguire my great grandfather. Mother's letters were a
      comfort. During the summer, Al and the older children bailed hay. We
      always had plenty to eat and it took quite a bit to keep a large family.
      We were all active in the branch in Porterville. In 1946, Jean was called
      on a mission to serve in the California Mission; she worked as a secretary
      in the mission home in San Francisco for several months, then in lone and
      Hanford for a total of 18 months. After her mission, she went to Salt Lake
      City to work to attend beauty school. Our 1ih child Linda Carol Blackburn
      was born on July 19, 1947 at the Tulare Hospital. We had six boys and six
      girls. Veva Mae Blackburn married Curtis Reeves in the Salt Lake Temple on
      August 26, 1947. We sold our ranch and moved to Delta, Utah in September
      of 1947. Work wasn't steady for Al in the hay mill so he left the family
      in Delta and returned to Porterville as a labor contractor; he made good
      money. The family stayed in Delta one year and then moved back to
      Porterville. Mother flew in a plane to see me while we lived in Delta.
      Jean's boyfriend in Salt Lake was a pilot and he brought her to Delta and
      in three days came back for her. She enjoyed the trip very much and we
      enjoyed having her stay with us. We bought a house with two acres of land
      in Westfield, California. We had a cow, sheep, chickens, turkeys and
      rabbits. Al worked as a labor contractor in the potatoes during the fall
      and winter months and hauled hay during the summer. If there was slack
      time, he worked on genealogy. Genealogy and temple work were our
      favorites. Our eldest son Bud Blackburn married Dolly Ann Thornton on
      April 19, 1949 in the St. George Temple. Betty Blackburn married Autis
      Kanady of Woodville. He was not a member of the church and they were
      married in Visalia on July 20, 1949. Jean Blackburn met Reed Durtschi from
      Driggs, Idaho and they married on November 22, 1950 in the Idaho Falls
      Temple. Al gave up his contractor's license because he was underbid so he
      went to Ogden to work for a frozen food plan called Rich Plan for a year.
      Being away from home didn't work out too well. We were going to move back
      to Ogden but with the Lord's help stayed in Porterville, California. Al
      worked at Riley's Appliances and Montgomery Ward, and then he worked as a
      liveryman for City Cleaners. After two years, he became manager and has
      worked there ever since. In 1955, Anita Blackburn received a call to the
      North Western States Mission and served for 18 months. Marilyn Blackburn
      married Leonard Higham in the St. George Temple on April 2, 1955 and on
      this same day, Betty and Autis Kanady were sealed in the temple and had
      their girls sealed to them. In November 1955, we moved to Success Valley
      and raised chickens for a feed company. Al still kept the cleaners and we
      all helped on the chicken ranch. The chicken project didn't turn out very
      successful so we put in turkeys. Robert Blackburn graduated from
      Porterville High School in 1956 and left for the Air Force. We lived in
      Success three years and in January of 1958, we moved to East Date Street
      in Porterville. Tom Blackburn was called on a mission to South Africa. He
      danced with joy to receive this mission call and left in May of 1960 for
      the mission home in Utah. Bob came home from the Air Force in January of
      1961; he received a mission call to East Central States. With the heavy
      expense of two sons on missions, I went to work for my husband at the
      cleaners. Before Tom got home from his mission in South Africa, Bill
      Blackburn was called to serve in Argentina. 1. Dr. Reed and Jean Durtschi

      see Bob. He had baptized them on his mission. Bob and Janice married on
      November 6, 1962 and live on a turkey ranch west of Porterville. 8. Tom
      Blackburn courted Dianna, and then went into the Army in January of 1963.
