      No. 7 -William Henry Eames William Henry Eames was born in Almo, Idaho on
      December 23, 1894 to Robert J. and Lucy Knight Eames. We lived on a farm
      in what is called the Big Cove. I was the 7th child in a family of 12. I
      was born in a log cabin that had five rooms and a back porch. It had a
      cellar where we kept our vegetables and other fresh produce, which was
      harvested, from our farm. Near the house was a large beautiful orchard
      where we raised our fruit. Close to the orchard was a shed and granary.
      The grain that was stored in the granary was used for feed and flour.
      There was a well in front of the house that my father, and brothers Lonnie
      and Robbie had dug. We used this water in our house. The woodpile by the
      well was replenished each fall. Father and the three boys would spend
      almost a whole week in the hills, which was some distance from our log
      cabin, cutting logs for the woodpile. We would cut enough to last the
      entire winter. Father went on a mission to Iowa in 1899 when I was only
      five years old; however, I had to help the older boys on the farm. I
      remember the rabbits I had under the house. I used to cut Lucerne for them
      to eat and one day, I cut my thumb so severely that I still have the scar.
      The cellar door afforded us much entertainment. My sister Ruby and I spent
      many happy hours sliding down the cellar door, which would make our dog,
      Rover, bark and play with us. One day, he became so excited that he bit
      her on the arm. I remember an old man by the name of Mr. Plumb who stayed
      with us and did odd jobs for father. He was afflicted with St. Vitas dance
      and when he drank his coffee, his hand would shake so terribly that he
      would spill it all over. One day, while we were all sitting at the dinner
      table, I laughed at him and the next think I knew, Mr. Plumb was shaking
      me good. When I was six years old, I started school. Our schoolhouse was a
      log cabin. It was about 1 1/2 -miles from our house. I walked to and from
      school each day until I was old enough to drive a team. I attended this
      school until I was about 10 and at that time father bought my Uncle Merle
      Heath's place, which was one mile west from the house we were living in.
      It was after this move that I changed schools and attended the Grape Creek
      School. I drove a team of horses hooked to a sleigh in the winter and a
      white top buggy in the spring this was much better than walking. When I
      was 10 years old, I remember that I had the job of riding the derrick
      horse and rack horse at haying time. At this time every year we would help
      our neighbors, the Durfees, who lived just over the hill from us, and they
      would help us. For recreation, my brothers, sisters and I would hunt
      rabbits, fish and ice skate. We had picnics at the City of Rocks, which
      was a nice place in the mountains (southwest of Almo) and it was in this
      area that we picked pine nuts. I remember one wintry day when it had
      turned extremely cold and I had urged the horses into a fast trot so that
      we could hurry and get to school. We came to a turn in the road and
      because we were traveling so fast, the box slid off the sleigh, which
      frightened the horses and caused them to run. I held onto the lines as
      long as I could but the horses continued to run and ran all the way to
      school. Needless to say, they got there before we did. Because father
      needed my help on the farm a great deal, I was never able to graduate from
      the 8th grade. We had good times at home, too. Mother and father bought a
      used organ, which my older sister Lizzie played when she was home. We
      would all gather around including my mother (bless her heart) and sing
      songs. Mother always taught me to pray when I was a small boy. I
      remembered these teachings throughout my life and gained much strength and
      guidance through prayer. One instance that illustrates my complete faith
      in the power of prayer happened when I was taking care of my younger
      sisters while mother and father were away. Opal was eating chicken and got
      a bone caught in her throat -it cut off her oxygen and she went black in
      the face. I told my sisters to all kneel down and pray for Opal, which
      they did and very soon she coughed up the chicken bone. Our trips to the
      mountains were not always just for picnics or pleasure. Whenever we needed
      them, my brother Robbie and I would go up after fence poles. We would go
      early in the morning and be gone all day. It would usually be dark before
      we could get loaded up. On one trip, we forgot the axe so Rob sent me down
      the canyon alone to get it. I was young and frightened half to death -in
      fact, the doctor told mother he thought that was the reason I came down
      with Typhoid Fever a short time later. It was sometime before they knew
      whether I would live or die, but finally through the fine care that mother
      gave me and through prayer, I came out of it. I had to learn to walk all
      over again. Mother and father always encouraged us to take part in church
      activities. On Saturday evenings, father would get a team of horses ready
      and would hitch them to the white top buggy on Sunday morning. Away we
      would all go to Sunday School, which as five miles away. Sometimes mother
      would prepare sandwiches and we would stay all day. We would have Sunday
      School and Sacrament Meeting soon after. One afternoon in Fast and
      Testimony Meeting, Sister Durfee, who was the President of Relief Society,
      got up to bear her testimony and started to speak in tongues. Bishop
      Durfee, her son, got up and interpreted what she said. We also attended
      Mutual. I played basketball on the Mutual team and it was while I was at
      Elba, Idaho playing basketball that I first became interested in a
      girlfriend. We enjoyed the dances sponsored by the Mutual and when a bunch
      of wild and wooly boyfriends would get together, we would really have a
      wonderful time. One night at Mutual we all got to laughing at our teacher
      who wore his glasses down on the end of his nose. Bishop Allen came in and
      took his boy out of the class; he then had the rest of us arrested by the
      constable. We all had to appear in court but were released very quickly. I
      was ordained a Deacon when I was 12 and passed the Sacrament. I fulfilled
      my requirements in the Priesthood always and was therefore, promoted, as
      should have been. With 12 children in our family, father was always very
      busy making "ends meet". Once or twice in the fall of the year, father
      would go to Montello, Nevada with a load of potatoes, apples and grain and
      had me to go with him. To get there, we traveled about 68 miles south into
      Utah and then 17 miles west into Nevada. On our way we camped out, once at
      the base of the mountain and again in Grouse Creek, Utah. We made our bed
      down by the wagons. Father drove one wagon and I drove the other. I lay
      there listening to the horses munch hay and watched the stars twinkle
      until I fell asleep. Father always took the rifle along in case we saw any
      wild animals. One morning, we started out and father saw a coyote running
      up a hill. We stopped the horses and took a couple of shots at the coyote
      -he came rolling down the hill and father sent me up to drag him down. We
      skinned him and sold the pelt when we got back home. These trips are my
      fondest memories, as a boy, of time spent with my father. John Hull bought
      a ranch in Alma when I was a young lad. He was an excellent trumpet player
      and he decided to get a group of boys and men together to form a band. My
      Uncle Harry Eames was made Assistant Bandleader and got me interested in
      playing an instrument in the band. The first instrument I had was a
      baritone, and later I changed to a solo alto. I rode a horse five miles
      once a week to practice with the band and after some time, we became a
      very fine band. We were invited to play at many celebrations and other
      gatherings. It seems that I had a nose for trouble. One afternoon I was
      riding a horse to a ballgame in Stravell, Idaho. I saw a young lady
      walking along and so I very gallantly asked her if she would care for a
      ride home. She lived down by the Raft River and when she got off the horse
      her boyfriend saw me. He took after me on his horse (he was big enough to
      eat me up). When he caught me, he dragged me off my horse and I ended up
      with a broken nose. When I was 19 (in 1913) my mother decided she wanted
      me to go to school in Oakley, Idaho to the old academy and take the
      Missionary Course. I liked the idea very much so my cousin Vern Eames and
      I went to Oakley and signed up for the course to prepare for a mission. My
      brother Rob was married but was living close enough to help father on the
      farm. However, at this time, he decided to leave so father could not spare
      me and I had to leave the school and go home. For this reason, I was never
      able to go on a mission. In 1915, father sold the ranch and came to Utah
      to care for my grandparents Alonzo and Catherine Knight who lived in Plain
      City. The Utah-Idaho Central Railroad was running a spur into the canning
      factory in Plain City and my first job was working on the tracks. About
      1917 my father bought a farm in Harrisville, Utah. My grandparents moved
      in with my family and stayed with us until their deaths. I continued to
      work for the Utah-Idaho Central Railroad on the section gang and then went
      up to work in the brickyard in Harrisville. I worked on the brick press
      and wheeled brick. It was while I was hauling that I dropped bricks on my
      left foot and smashed my big toe. I had just recently met Winnifred Lowder
      (who later became my wife) and it was her mother, Ida Lowder, who treated
      my toe every day for about two weeks. It was during this time in November
      of 1917 that I became better acquainted with Winnifred and we had an
      opportunity to teach Sunday School together. William H. Eames & Winnifred
      Lowder On August 21, 1918, Winnifred and I married. She was 19 and I was
      23. We left at 6 AM on the morning of the 21st on the Bamberger train to
      go to the Salt Lake Temple. It took us all day to go through the temple
      and return to Harrisville. World War I was raging at that time and the
      temple was filled with young service men and their brides. Because of my
      foot injury, I was not able to get into the Army. Winnifred looked
      beautiful in her white wedding dress. I gave her a plain gold wedding band
      that has since been replaced with two diamond rings set in platinum. Her
      engagement ring was a ruby set in a tiffany setting. Our daughter Betty
      Eames is still wearing the ring, which is in the original setting. After
      our wedding, Winnifred's parents, William and Ida Lowder, gave us a party.
      It was held outside on the lawn and over 250 people came. We received many
      lovely gifts. I remember driving dad's team of horses hitched to her
      folks' white top buggy to get chairs for the party and Winnifred's
      brother, Milo, going with me. I drove the team on a dead run through the
      gate onto the road. I had to make a quick turn and the buggy went on two
      wheels. Poor Milo Lowder laid flat on his stomach in the bottom of the
      buggy. He thought I was the wildest driver he had ever seen and I guess I
      frightened him nearly to death! We lived with Winnifred's folks for four
      months. They were the grandest people on earth to us. I was young and
      inexperienced so I worked at whatever job I could get. One day my
      father-in-law told me he would have to talk with Rufus Garner, Assistant
      Postmaster of the Ogden Post Office. They were good friends and after he
      talked with him, they put me to work carrying Special Deliveries. It was
      at this time that we bought a little two-room house in Harrisville. I
      borrowed Milo's bicycle and rode it back and forth from our house in
      Harrisville to the Ogden Post Office and I carried Special Deliveries on
      it all day. One Halloween night, it was late and I was in a hurry riding
      along the trail. I had to cross a ditch on a small bridge, which to my
      consternation, had previously been removed by a group of boys who were
      pulling their usual Halloween pranks. I hit that ditch and went flying
      through the air. When I picked myself up, I was surprised and very happy
      to find that neither my bicycle nor I were broken up. We lived in that
      little house in Harrisville about one year and then sold it to Hyrum
      Romrell who was our neighbor. He paid us $500, which was what we had paid
      for it originally. We bought a house at 832 26th Street in Ogden and lived
      in Ogden for the next 44 years. Our three oldest girls were born on 26th
      Street: Erma, Mildred and Betty Eames in that order. I was still working
      at the Post Office and still rode my bicycle back and forth. I worked from
      3:30 PM until midnight. After I would leave for work, Winnifred put
      Mildred and Erma in the buggy and walked up to her mother's house at 2669
      Van Buren Avenue. She stayed there until almost time for me to come home,
      and then she would wheel the girls back home. During this time, my church
      activities varied; however, I remember being Secretary of the Elders
      Quorum and a Ward Teacher. One year we borrowed Dad's car, it had hard
      rubber tires on it. We took the three girls and as we felt we had room for
      one more, we asked Winnifred's sister Dott Lowder to come with us. We
      started out at 4 AM for Almo, Idaho to see my sister Alice and her husband
      Asael Ward. On the other side of Tremonton, Utah, we had to unload and
      pack our things up the hill (this car wouldn't pull your hat off) and to
      top it all off the windshield fell out on Aunt Dott's lap. Dott was a good
      sport and held it on her lap all the way to Almo. We didn't arrive in Almo
      until 2 AM the next morning -we had a wonderful time anyway. We lived on
      26th Street for six years and then we bought a house at 1068 29th Street.
      The girls were old enough to start school and they went to Quincy School
      that was five or six blocks from our house. Our oldest daughter Erma had
      quite a time adjusting to school. Mother would take her over to school and
      she would no more than get home when Erma would arrive back home. I was in
      the presidency of the YMMIA in the 17th Ward while we lived on 29th
      Street. In fact, we helped build the 17th Ward while we lived there. Those
      were happy days. Every year we would go on a vacation and take the family
      with us. I bought an old Chevrolet and we drove to Yellowstone Park,
      Wyoming and to Canada to visit my sisters Lizzie King and Ruby McMullin
      and their families. i remember a trip to Portland, Oregon where we went to
      see my sister Lucy Stout who lived in a little town just on the edge of
      Portland. She lived in a little cabin in a beautiful grove of trees with a
      canyon close by. Near to where she lived, there was a blind man who lived
      in a little shack by the Columbia River. He earned money by setting crab
      traps in the bottom of the Columbia River to catch crabs to sell to
      restaurants. The girls had fun swinging in a big tire swing tied to the
      large trees and they also played in the canyon. This vacation trip to see
      Lucy was one of our nicest trips we ever took. We took many trips up Ogden
      Canyon for fishing and picnicking. One trip we took with Winnifred's
      brother Oscar Lowder and his family. Our car was so loaded that we had to
      drop our tent off to go up the hill and when we went back to pick it up,
      someone had taken it. We had to improvise sleeping facilities by cutting
      limbs off trees to make our bed and stretched a canvas over our heads for
      cover. We took another trip with Oscar and his family to Jackson Lake in
      Wyoming. Oscar and his family were ahead of us in their car and we were
      driving along rather cautiously on a winding road when we came to a
      hairpin turn. Because I didn't see it soon enough, instead of staying on
      the road, we took off through the brush and our oldest girl Erma landed on
      top of the 10 pounds of bananas. We all laughed despite our fright, as the
      girls were only concerned about the bananas. When we arrived at the lake,
      Oscar told us that he had almost gone off the road too. We rented a cabin
      and stayed a few days, fished and had lots of fun. It was nice to know our
      girls were having a good time along with us. Although the girls are all
      grownup now, they still reminisce about the many wonderful vacations we
      took together. Many times Winnifred and I had an extremely difficult time
      financing the trips but we loved adventure and if we camped out instead of
      renting cabins and took food along, we went very inexpensively. Much of
      the closeness, which our family maintained throughout the years, can be
      attributed to our sharing time with our girls. As our family got older, we
      had to have more room so we turned our place in on a larger house on 1022
      24th Street where our youngest daughter Carolyn Eames was born. The girls
      soon became active in the 13th Ward. Mildred and Betty studied music and
      played the piano in Primary and played duets at church gatherings.
      Winnifred became active in Relief Society and I was asked to be in the
      presidency of the YMMIA. Later, I was set apart as the Ward Clerk under
      Bishop Edward Chambers. President Samuel G. Dye ordained me a High Priest,
      which has meant a great deal to me throughout the years. My wife was good
      to help me with my church work. As Ward Clerk, I had to put in many hours
      making out reports. We made many fine and lasting friendships through our
      associations and work in the 13th Ward. Our daughters became teenagers
      when we lived on 24th Street and were always playing pranks. One time when
      my daughter Betty came in from a date, we were in bed asleep thinking that
      she was also in bed. Erma and Carolyn saw the lights go on and off in the
      living room and thought that a burglar had come in. They crept into our
      room and awakened me so suddenly that I was nearly frightened to death. As
      I grabbed the living room doorknob, poor Betty took hold of it on the
      other side. I held the door fast and shouted, "who's there?" Betty and
      laugh now because we wonder which one of us was the most frightened. While
      we were living on 24th Street, Erma met Floyd Young. They were married in
      the Salt Lake Temple. After 11 years on 24th Street, we decided to build a
      home so I bought a lot on 1100 block of Porter Avenue and built a five
      room brick house. My father passed away and mother moved to Salt Lake City
      into an apartment across the street from the Salt Lake Temple where she
      did temple work each day. For the first time in many many years, my family
      was together for father's funeral. We had our picture taken and it means a
      great deal to me now. I was the only brother alive with seven sisters. My
      sister Viola and her husband Martin Harris took over the folk's house in
      Harrisville and mother continued to live in the shadow of the temple for
      many years until she passed away. Our daughters Mildred and Betty
      graduated from Ogden High School and went to work at the Utah General
      Depot, working for the defense of our country because we were fighting
      World War II. Many people moved into the Ogden area at this time because
      many plants were built there during the war. The city government asked
      Ogden residents to build apartments in their homes to help the housing
      shortage that was created and so we finished off some rooms in our
      basement and took in some boys. This caused us nothing but headaches and
      hard work for Winnifred because the boys nearly ate her out of house and
      home. Erma and Floyd were living in an apartment in the basement of our
      home during this time. In August of 1924, I had an operation for a double
      hernia and after going to two doctors, a chiropractor, my wife's good care
      and many prayers, I finally was well enough to go back to work around the
      first of the year. When Mildred and Betty were working at the Utah General
      Depot, they both married. Mildred married Fred Wilson, Jr. who was
      employed at the Depot so they moved into an apartment in Ogden. Betty
      married Herbert Brown in the Logan Temple. He was a pilot in the Air Force
      and was stationed in Deming, New Mexico at that time so Betty moved to
      Deming, and then continued to move around with him until after the war
      ended. Erma and Floyd moved out of our basement into an apartment by
      themselves and we sold our house on Porter and moved into the Tribe
      Apartments. Our daughter Carolyn was in high school then. After we moved
      into an apartment, Winnifred was a bit freer from housework and because
      the defense plants needed help, she went to work at the Utah General
      Depot. This was the first and only time that she worked outside of our
      home. The mail load increased at the Hill Air Force Branch Post Office so
      I was asked to go work with Frank Hazen who was the Superintendent there.
      Up until this time I had worked at the Ogden Post Office since I began my
      career with the US Postal Service. I worked with Mr. Hazen until April
      1945 when I was appointed Superintendent of the Branch and he was
      appointed Superintendent of Mails. I worked there for 12 years driving 30
      miles a day. I took riders, which helped on the expense of maintaining my
      automobile. --. Winnifred & William Eames I have many pleasant memories of
      those years at Hill Field where I met many nice people. The military
      personnel invited my family to their Christmas party and would give gifts
      to the children. I bought a pair of Chinchillas for a new hobby. Since I
      had no place to keep them, I ranched them out and as time went by they
      increased in number and I enjoyed learning how to raise Chinchillas.
      Because of the sudden changes in temperature and other complications that
      arose, the Chinchillas began to die so I sold the ones that were left. In
      1951, our daughter Mildred and her husband Fred built a house on 26th
      Street. They had been living in Harris Apartments on Adams Avenue and when
      they finished their home, they moved out and we moved in their old
      apartment. I was made chairman of the High Priests group of the 6th Ward
      and held this position for two years. During this time, I was instrumental
      in helping our Quorum become the first group to put a calf on the Ogden
      Stake Welfare Farm in Huntsville. The Quorum gave donations and through
      the efforts of Brother Frank Bingham, who deals in livestock, purchased
      the calf. During the next few years, we moved several times. Carolyn quit
      high school and at the age of 17, married Marion Albiston. After they had
      three of their four children, they were sealed in the Salt Lake Temple. I
      retired on February 1, 1957 from the Post Office. Later that year, my
      daughters and their husbands took us to a lovely restaurant for dinner to
      celebrate my retirement and our 39th wedding anniversary. They gave me a
      nice book and Mildred and Fred gave me a 10-year membership in the duck
      club. This event meant a great deal to mother and I. We now live in a
      small house on #6 Custer Court where we expect to stay. We have enough
      room for our girls and grandchildren to come and visit but are not
      burdened with too much housework or yard work. Our daughters are raising
      their families now. Erma is clerking in a drug store in Ogden and her
      husband Floyd Young is a grocery Produce Manager; they have three
      children: Larry, Sharon and Ricky Young. Larry is the oldest boy and
      served six months in the Army after he graduated from high school and
      attended Weber State College and is a salesman at a men's clothing store.
      Sharon is going to Ben Loman High School and is active in her ward. Ricky
      the youngest boy is in elementary school. Erma died in 1991. Mildred was
      married 17 years before her son Randy Wilson was born and is her only
      child. She worked for First Security Bank in Ogden. She and her husband
      separated about the time that Randy was born. Betty worked for the Board
      of Education as a secretary to the Superintendent of Schools in Columbia,
      Missouri for three years. She taught junior Sunday School for 17 years and
      was in the Primary organization for 1O years. Her husband Herbert Brown
      has been active in their branch teaching and was second Counselor in the
      Superintendence of the Sunday School. He graduated from the University of
      Utah with a PhD in Anatomy and then they moved to Missouri where he taught
      and did research at the University of Missouri. He holds the rank of a
      Major in the Air Force Reserves. They have two children: James Brown is in
      high school and Kathleen Brown is in junior high. They are active in
      church and school and have both taken piano lessons. Carolyn has five
      children (four boys and one girl). Gregory Albiston is in junior high
      school; Scott, David and Deborah Albiston are in elementary school and
      Steven Albiston is the baby. They are active in their ward. Her husband
      Marion Albiston graduated from the University of Utah with a BA. He works
      for Pierce Music Company as Assistant Manager and is playing in the Utah
      Symphony as the first trombonist. Carolyn died in 1981. I am sorry I did
      not keep a diary of my life. It's difficult for me to express the fullness
      of my life and I omitted many things in order to be brief. Winnifred
      wrote: "I am thankful to Robert J. and Lucy Knight Eames for their son
      William who became my husband. We have never had worldly riches nor have
      been unkind to each other but we were blessed with four beautiful
      daughters and 11 grandchildren, which means so much to us now that we are
      older. We have always strived to live a good life and teach our family the
      same thing. The Lord blessed us in so many ways these blessings we are
      indeed grateful for. Winnifred Eames died on April 28, 1967 from heart
      failure. Three years later, William married Ethelyn Shaw.
